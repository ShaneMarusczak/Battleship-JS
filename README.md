# Battleship-JS

All logic for the Battleship computer player is done in client side JS. This project is under development and is not in its final form.
Please feel free to create a branch and make this better. 
The site is not responsive at all. It only displays properly in a full screen desktop browser.
The HTML is a relative mess. The JS is messy as well.
I am working on cleaning up the code.
